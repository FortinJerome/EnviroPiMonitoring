# EnviroPiMonitoring
# Python project to capture, record and process sensor data from a Pimoroni Enviro Hat on a Pi Zero 2 W
# 
# 2024-05-07 This project is intended as a self learning project using Python. Use at your own risks
# Hardware used: 
# - PiMoroni Enviro Hat Mini with the following sensors https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro?variant=31155658489939
# 
#     - BME280 temperature, pressure, humidity sensor (datasheet)
#     - LTR-559 light and proximity sensor (datasheet)
#     - MEMS microphone (datasheet)
#     - 0.96" colour LCD (160x80)
#     - Pimoroni breakout-compatible pin header
#     - pHAT-format board
#     - Fully-assembled
#     - Compatible with all 40-pin header Raspberry Pi models
#     - Python library
#     - Dimensions: 65x30x8.5mm
# 
# -   Pi Zero 2 W (will be tested on other Pi platforms)

# Project objectives:
# - Provide step by step on configuring Linux instance with all required dependencies
# - Collect data from all sensors into either flat file or database
# - Forward data to a reporting service (TBD) like grafana
# 
# Future releases:
# - Future release will focus on migrating over to micro python to run on a microcontroller
